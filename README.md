A simple scrabble clone with letter crafting. puzzle games with crafting.

Initially, I tried to do the same thing with a code editor. That was hilarious, but also ultimately not usable in any meaningful way. So I scrapped it and went with scrabble.

This is my first LD in a few years and I'm measurable less good at it than in the past though my hours per output is good I'm approaching on Sunday what used to be okay I can go to bed on Friday night.
